v1.0.0

## Stable API

Settled on an API and scope for the project.

domco follows semantic versioning, so there will no longer be breaking changes between minor versions now that the project is v1.

## Breaking changes

None from v0.13, if upgrading from a lower version [see the changelog](https://github.com/rossrobino/domco/blob/main/packages/domco/CHANGELOG.md) or consult the [documentation](https://domco.robino.dev) for details.
