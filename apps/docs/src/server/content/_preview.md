domco seamlessly integrates a server into your [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) application, allowing you to add an API or server render pages. domco supports the standard default [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) export API, just like [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/fetch/#syntax), [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/api/http#export-default-syntax), and [Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/http_server/#default-fetch-export).

With domco, you can develop and deploy using Node.js, providing the flexibility to stay within a familiar environment, while also supporting other runtimes. Additionally, you gain access to Viteâ€™s build pipeline, plugin ecosystem, and live reloading out of the box.

## Features

- Automatic [entry point configuration](/tutorial#entry-points) for client and server builds.
- Development and preview server configuration.
- Easy [access to client resources](/tutorial#virtual-modules) on the server.
- Build time [prerendering](/tutorial#prerender) of static routes.
- Standardized authoring experience across runtimes and deployment providers with [adapters](/deploy#adapters).

## Add a framework, or don't

Achieve the same developer experience as other frameworks that are based around a UI library, without having to pull in additional dependencies. By default, domco only bundles only the code you write, making it efficient and straightforward.

If you need a UI framework, you can still use any [Vite plugin](https://vitejs.dev/plugins/) as you would in a traditional Vite application. These plugins will also work on the server.

The `create` script also comes with templates for the following server frameworks:

- [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com)
- [h3](https://h3.dev)
- [Hono](https://hono.dev)
- [mono-jsx](https://github.com/ije/mono-jsx)
- [Remix](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/tree/main/packages/fetch-router)
- [ovr](https://ovr.robino.dev)

## Only what you need

domco is [lightweight](https://npmgraph.js.org/?q=domco), relying solely on Vite as its dependency. This results in quick installation times, fast build and development processes, and a reduced risk of supply chain attacks.
